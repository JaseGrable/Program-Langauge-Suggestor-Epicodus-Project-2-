## Description

* This is a website that I built for my coding bootcamp at Epicodus. The questionaire is just for fun. The form will ask you five simple questions. Based on your answers you will figure out what coding language to learn. A "yes" answer will suggest a lanuage, while a "no" answer will reveal another question. Answering "no" to all five questions will reset the form.  


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Navigate to top level directory
* open index.html in your browswer
* answer yes or no questions in form to find out what you should learn


## Known Bugs

* yes answers show twice if "yes" has been previously answered
